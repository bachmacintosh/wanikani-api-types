Regularly updated type definitions for the [WaniKani API](https://docs.api.wanikani.com/20170710/)

## Documentation

## Package Versioning

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), with versions formatted as x.y.z.

A new Patch Version z includes backwards-compatible bug fixes, corrections to documentation, and other relatively insignificant changes.

A new Minor Version y includes new backwards-compatible library features, new backwards-compatible WaniKani API changes (e.g. new revision, new fields on a resource, etc.), widened TypeScript version support, and deprecatiung (but not removing) existing features to be removed in the next major version.

A new Major Version x includes backwards-incompatible changes such as removing previously deprecated items, backwards-incompatible WaniKani API changes (e.g. removing a field on a resource), or a [breaking change in TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Breaking-Changes) that's introduced into the library (we'll try to avoid these as much as possible).

| Package Version | TypeScript Versions | WaniKani API Version | Latest API Revision |
| --------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1.x             | 4.5 - 5.7           | 2                    | 20170710            |

## Install

### NPM / Yarn / pnpm

<details>
<summary>Click/Tap to Show Instructions</summary>

Run the following command pertaining to your package manager:

```shell
npm install @bachmacintosh/wanikani-api-types
```

```shell
yarn add @bachmacintosh/wanikani-api-types
```

```shell
pnpm install @bachmacintosh/wanikani-api-types
```

Then, import using one of two methods.

#### Specific API Revision (Recommended)

The module you import from matches a [WaniKani API Revision](https://docs.api.wanikani.com/20170710/#revisions-aka-versioning); you shouldn't expect any breaking changes from the package.

```typescript
import type { WKAssignmentParameters, WKDatableString } from "@bachmacintosh/wanikani-api-types/dist/v20170710";
import { stringifyParameters } from "@bachmacintosh/wanikani-api-types/dist/v20170710";
```

#### Latest API Revision (Not Recommended)

Importing from the index module will always provide types, methods, etc. for use with the latest and greatest API Revision.

```typescript
import type { WKAssignmentParameters, WKDatableString } from "@bachmacintosh/wanikani-api-types";
import { stringifyParameters } from "@bachmacintosh/wanikani-api-types";
```

### Deno via NPM Specifier

<details>
<summary>Click/Tap to Show Instructions</summary>

Deno version 1.28 and up can import the library using an [npm specifier](https://deno.land/manual@v1.31.3/node/npm_specifiers).

**Be sure to replace `x.y.z` with your desired version number.**

#### Specific API Revision (Recommended)

The module you import from matches a [WaniKani API Revision](https://docs.api.wanikani.com/20170710/#revisions-aka-versioning); you shouldn't expect any breaking changes from the package.

```typescript
import type {
  WKAssignmentParameters,
  WKDatableString,
} from "npm:@bachmacintosh/wanikani-api-types@x.y.z/dist/v20170710";
import { stringifyParameters } from "npm:@bachmacintosh/wanikani-api-types@x.y.z/dist/v20170710";
```

#### Latest API Revision (Not Recommended)

Importing from the index module will always provide types, methods, etc. for use with the latest and greatest API Revision.

```typescript
import type { WKAssignmentParameters, WKDatableString } from "npm:@bachmacintosh/wanikani-api-types@x.y.z";
import { stringifyParameters } from "npm:@bachmacintosh/wanikani-api-types@x.y.z";
```

</details>

### Other Environments

## Usage

### Type Definitions

We provide various type definitions to help with sending/receiving type-safe elements to/from the WaniKani API.

- **Base Types** that define essential WaniKani API building blocks
- **Collections/Reports/Resources** that represent whole responses from the API
- **Data** that represents only the actual returned data from the API (i.e. the `data` field on most responses)
- **Parameter Types** that can be broken down into a query string to append to a URI for the API (especially when fetching Collections) -- see below.
- **Payloads** that represent JSON bodies sent to the API when creating/updating certain resources

We also export various subtypes that fall underneath these main types, in case they're needed to work with partial data.

### Type Guards

Most of the types defined here are object types with straightforward structure. Sometimes, however, you may have a string or number that needs to meet specific criteria to be narrowed down to an exact type. So we provide some [type guards](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#using-type-predicates) to verify if a variable is of a given type; these will usually begin with `is` in their name (e.g. `isWKDatableString`). See the documentation for more info.

## Request Factory

We provide a special class, `WKRequestFactory`, that returns Request objects with all the information you need to make a request to the WaniKani API. That means the request's method (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`), the URL (with parameters for Collections or an ID for individual Resources), headers (Authorization, conditional headers, etc.), and a body if you are sending data. You can use these objects in your preferred HTTP API/Library such as the Fetch API, Axios, Needle, Node's `https` Module, etc.

### Helper Functions

There are also multiple helper functions that can assist with formatting and/or validating data sent to the WaniKani API, outside of and in addition to the Request Factory.

- `stringifyParameters` converts a Parameters object (e.g. `WKAssignmentParameters`) into a URL query string to use when filtering a Collection
- `validateParameters` does runtime validation on a Parameters object, allowing for more strict validation than TypeScript's type narrowing behavior (i.e. not allowing widening to `WKCollectionParameters`); it's a good function for those who must be absolutely sure their parameters are of the exact type.
- `validatePayload` does runtime validation of Payload objects; while most TypeScript and editor-assisted projects likely won't need this function, it can be useful for pure JavaScript applications.

### Markup Matchers

When working with WaniKani's Subjects, you may want to stylize/highlight the markup that's inside the reading/meaning mnemonics and hints. We provide some Regex Literals that can be used to extract one or more of these sorts of markup in `WK_SUBJECT_MARKUP_MATCHERS`.

### Examples

See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for examples using this library.
